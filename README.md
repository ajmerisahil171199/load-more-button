Showcasing your content on the web is more essential than ever but there's so much content and only so much real estate on a web page before the viewer stops scrolling. Web designers and developers have recognized this behavior in website visitors and implement different techniques to display content in the most intuitive way while still providing the volume of content some visitors may require. Your blog may have 1,000 entries but you don't want to show all of them on a single page or it will take an extremely long time to load and cause an information overload that may even increase your bounce rates. In the case of these 1,000 entries developers would likely "lazy load" any entries over a certain integer. In our example, we don't have 1,000 entries so a simple "Load More" and some JavaScript will suffice.
